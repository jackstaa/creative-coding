        The generative landscape I have created is supposed to be a take on a soft landscape
        The idea is to have the mountains rise up behind the sea whilst still using soft colors, gradients, and randomness
        You'll notice that the sky of the landscape is always going to be more red, orange, and yellow than a cool color
        this is to reflect the sun's rays
        and the sea will always be some shade of blue-ish green to reflect all types of water

        I wanted to have the mountains be a wide variety of colors, not really sure exactly why, but I like the way it can contrast against the sky and the sea.
