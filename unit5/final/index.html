<!-- Hello and welcome to my "final" project final being in quotes because I still gotta do the portfolio
This project is inspired by a game I used to play quite a bit several years ago called "Jump King"
If you have fun playing this I highly suggest you buy jump king on steam because not only is it way better than this game its also more difficult
The rules are simple, jump left and right to reach the top of the game
There are some quirks though, sometimes it takes a few trys to jump depending on how long you hold space,
and you need to make sure you are holding down the left/right key (A or D) after letting go of the spacebar
This project was created with collaboration with claude.ai
